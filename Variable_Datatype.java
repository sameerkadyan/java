//      Variable 

//      A variable name is memory location that used to store data. Its act like container  for values that can be accessed, modified and manupulated throughout of a java program.






//      Data Type 

//      There are mainly two type of data type

/*      1. primitive data type. |-->  These are the basic built in data types provides by
                                        java. They are store single values and are not
                                        object.

        2. Non-primitive data type. |-->  These are types that refer to objects and creating
                                            using classes. interfaces , array etc.

                |                                                      |
                |--> byte                                              |--> string
                |--> short                                             |--> Arrays
                |--> int                                               |--> Class/Objects
                |--> long                                              |--> Interface
                |--> float
                |--> double
                |--> char
                |--> boolean


    Note :- 
            primitive --> These are stored directly in memeory in memory and faster and
                            lightweight.
            
            Non-primitive --> These are store references (adderess in memory), not the
                                actual value.

    Important Notes:-
                        Default values:
                                        Primitive: 0, false, '\u0000' (depends on type).
                                        Non-Primitive: null.
                        
                        Primitive types are not objects but can be converted into objects via Wrapper Classes (e.g., Integer, Double, Character).
